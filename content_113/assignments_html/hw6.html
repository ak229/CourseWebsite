                Download the given code and use it to host your own movie review web site on the CSE servers. In this
                site, your users will be able to submit songs by title, artist, and YouTube link while all users can
                comment on the songs that have been submitted. Most of the
                files can
                be used as-is while the hw6Server.py file must be completed for the assignment. In this file, you will
                be writing the SQL queries necessary to to store and retrieve the data your users submit.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will host this site on the CSE servers at the url
                "http://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~&lt;ubit&gt;/music.html" where &lt;ubit&gt; is the ubit
                of the user whose site you want to visit.

            <p>
                In addition to all the permissions discussed in lab and lecture, set the permissions of your server
                folder in the homework code to 700.
