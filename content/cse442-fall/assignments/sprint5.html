== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Share your project with the world for all to enjoy!</li>
</ul>

== Overview

<p>
    You've put in 12 weeks of hard work to complete a great project. Now it's time to share your work with the world!
</p>

<p>
    This sprint is graded on a group basis.
</p>


== Documentation (4 Points)

<p>
    Sufficient documentation such that a user unfamiliar with your project can understand how to use your deployed
    software. The specific documentation will depend on your project and intended user.
</p>


== Deployment (4 points)

<p>
    Deploy your project to the world. Users of your software must be able to use your software for its intended use
    without contacting your group. Deployment strategies will vary for each individual project.
</p>


== Release Video (4 points)

<p>
    Think KickStarter. A commercial for your product or a call for investors. Show off what you've done!
</p>

<p>
    This video must be self-contained (ie. assume the viewer knows nothing about your project and has not seen the
    previous videos). There is no time requirement for this video, though keep in mind that there is beauty in brevity.
