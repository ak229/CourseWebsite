== Objectives
<ul>
    <li>Form a team and choose a project</li>
</ul>


== Form a Group and choose a Project (1 point)

<p>
    Submit project proposal along with your group members. Only one member of the group needs to submit. Individuals
    will
    only get points if they are in a group that has been submitted.
</p>

<p>
    You have freedom to choose your group members and project idea under two conditions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Groups must have at least 3 members.</li>
    <li>Projects must be substantial enough to justify a group of seniors working for an entire semester.</li>
</ul>


== Create a Slack Channels (1 Point)

<p>
    Create a public slack channel for your group on CSE Software (<a href="https://cse-software.slack.com/">https://cse-software.slack.com/</a>)
    and add a short channel description listing your group
    members
    and a description of your projects. This will be your primary channel for group communication.
</p>
<p>
    Also create a private slack channel and add your group members and course staff to the channel. This private channel
    will only be used for sensitive communication with the course staff.
</p>
<p>
    Slack will be used by the course staff for all communication regarding this course. You are responsible for the
    information posted on slack.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">It is highly recommended that you download and install a client for slack and turn on
    notifications.
