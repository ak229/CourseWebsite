== Group Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are evaluated on a group basis. All members of the group will share the same score for these
    points.
</p>

= Group Communication (1 point)

<p>
    All required meetings have occurred and the minutes for each have been pushed to the group repo. For each sprint,
    excluding sprint 1, this will include 3 weekly meetings with the groups TA, 3 weekly group meetings without course
    staff, and 1 meeting with the course instructor. Minutes for all 7 meetings must appear in the group repo. If a
    single meeting is missed by the entire group, or the minutes are not uploaded, this point will not be awarded.
</p>
<p>
    If the quality of the meetings or minutes are poor this points might not be awarded, but more importantly the
    minutes
    will
    be used to track any issues that the group members have been facing. There are often unforeseen issues and
    complications
    while writing code that can turn a 10 minute task into a week-long time sink. If a task is not completed by the end
    of a sprint but there are well documented complications that appear in the minutes throughout the sprint this can be
    used to your advantage to potentially get credit for an incomplete task. If a task is not completed and there has
    been no communication about a complication then no
    credit can be given for the task.
</p>

= Group Version Control (1 point)

<p>
    The group has been properly applying the branching model used for this course. Specifically, the group has a master
    and development branch which the group members only merge into and never push to directly. Group members create
    feature branches off of develop to work on their tasks and merge the branch into develop when the task is complete.
</p>
<p>
    This point can still be awarded even if a few group members are violating the branching model. If the group as a
    whole is not implementing the branching model this point will not be awarded.
</p>

= Group Task Completion / Version Release (1 point)

<p>
    The next working version of the software has been merged from develop to master and is tagged as release "v0.2.0" in
    GitHub. The software must have some functionality added since the previous sprint. If at least
    one group member completed all their tasks and merged them into master then this point is awarded.
</p>

= Video (1 point)

<p>
    Upload a demo of your software to YouTube. This video must give an accurate view of the current state of your
    project and show the running software. This video will be directed towards a non-technical audience and will show
    them the current working functionality that has been implemented. You should not be scrolling through code in this
    video.
</p>
<p>
    This video must be shorter than 2 minutes to get credit for the video. This will be strictly enforced. The goal is
    to quickly communicate the status of your product to the end user.
</p>

== Individual Points

<p>
    The following 4 points are all evaluated on an individual basis.
</p>

= Individual Communication with the Group (1 point)

<p>
    (Bail out punishment. If you’re absent or causing your group stress “I’m
    not sure how his tasks are coming along” then you lose this point. Checked via attendance on minutes and feedback
    from
    group/TA/me.
</p>

= Individual Version Control (1 point)

<p>
    Working on feature branch and merging when complete. Pushing on a regular basis with
    meaningful commit messages. Since there must be regular pushing, this point is not awarded if little/no work is
    complete. Meaningless pushes will also be ignored.. might rename this point.
</p>

<p>he</p>

= Individual Task Progress (1 point)

<p>
    Substantial progress has been made on the assigned task(s) for this sprint. If no task
    is assigned in GitHub, this point is a 0.
</p>

= Individual Task Completion (1 point)

<p>
    Task/feature completed and merged into develop without breaking the project. Can
    potentially get this point without completing the task. The key is keeping the TA and myself posted throughout the
    sprint and document snags in the meeting notes. No chance of getting the point if we don’t hear about it until the
    end
    of the sprint. “Well I tried to get it working at the last minute, but I suck”. If no task is assigned in GitHub,
    this
    point is a 0.
